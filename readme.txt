Hello,

This is a Code Camp 16 presentation demo application for learning Java. The project you see is source code you can clone onto your machine using:

git clone REPOSITORYURLHERE

Then open directly from IntelliJ Community Edition.

This java project is built using Maven for dependency management and the pom.xml file is where your library dependencies will be added
